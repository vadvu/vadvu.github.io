I am a Research Fellow at [Center for Stability and Risk Analysis](https://social.hse.ru/en/mr/) at [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/) (and MA student) in Moscow, Russia, working on research in the spehere of comparative politics and sociolgy using quantitative methods. My primary focus now is on mass mobilization studies and revolutions. Also I am interested in demography in the sphere of russian mortality and in Big History. 

A high-principled warrior against linear propabiolity model and "the end of revolutions" view.
